1. Add placeholders for all input fileds in Contact section.

2. Add script for the send message button, so that everytime when the user clicks the button, a confirm message is pop up on the window. If the user clicks cancel, nothing will happen, but if the user clicks ok, a message will be printed out as a output underneath.

3. Make some minor change to the style and add two scripts for phone number and email address. For example when clicking the phone number or email, a window will pop up to indicate whether to send an email or call, and then can link to a 3rd party app for use.

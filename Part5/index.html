        <h2 id="aboutme">About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm an undergraduate student at the University of California, San
          Diego (UCSD), where I'm majoring in computer science. My passion for
          computer science has led me to explore various fields, including
          graphics, machine learning, and network, and I've taken many classes
          to broaden my knowledge. Lately, I've become particularly interested
          in web development and find it to be my favorite field.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond my studies, I'm an avid sports fan, with basketball being a
          particular favorite of mine. I'm a big fan of the Golden State
          Warriors, among other NBA teams. In my free time, I also enjoy
          watching movies and playing video games. I have an eclectic taste in
          music and enjoy listening to various genres, although I've recently
          developed a keen interest in Korean Hip-hop. Additionally, I enjoy
          traveling to new places and experiencing different cultures and trying
          out new cuisines.
